(1, '<p>(Formerly ACS-AD 101X)<br>How have anthropologists encountered, written about, and produced the “Arab world” over the past century? Beginning with early Western travelers’ imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region. Through ethnography, literature, film and fieldwork, we will explore such topics as Orientalism and its legacy; constructs of youth, gender, family and tribe; poetry and mediation; generational and social change; oil, development and globalization; transnational labor, migration and diaspora; Indian Ocean networks; pilgrimage and piety; the Islamic Revival; faith, medicine, and bioethics; displacement and dispossession; refugees and human rights; and the Arab uprisings.</p>', 'false', 'ACS-UH 1010X', 'Anthropology and the Arab World', 'false'),

The transformation of poetic form and the emergence of modern genres, such as drama, the novel, and the short story, will be examined in relation to classical Arabic and European genres. We will also discuss the relationship between aesthetic developments and their historical, political, and intellectual contexts.</p>', 'false', 'ACS-UH 1011X', 'Introduction to Modern Arabic Literature', 'false'),
(3, '<p>(Formerly ACS-AD 131X)<br>At the crossroads between Asia, Africa and Europe, the region that Europeans and North Americans labeled “The Middle East” presents a dynamic and heterogeneous landscape of peninsulas and isthmuses, republics and monarchies, oil producing countries, and labor exporting nations.

In this course, we will immerse ourselves in the lives and cultures of the Arab merchant communities that settled in China from the early days of Islam until the early modern period. We will learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the “Arabian Seas.” We will learn to think like medieval seamen and seawomen. We will read the narratives of Arab merchants such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who  came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries.

Topics include the impacts of human settlement, especially on water resources, inter-regional and global trade, colonization, and urbanization. Finally, we will look at what governments and global institutions have done to address some problems emerging in these zones. Learning will take place through informal lectures, guided tours of key sites, activities such as walking, boating, and swimming to get an embodied sense for these zones, recording through sketching or photography, interviewing various people knowledgeable about the issues at hand, not to mention people affected by their changing surroundings.

(33, '<p>(Formerly ANTH-AD 103J)<br>Buenos Aires and Beyond:  In the last decades, Latin America, has been undergoing rapid urbanization, not unlike most developing regions across the world.  Today, Latin America is increasingly recognized as a continent made up of “countries of cities,” where the number of intermediary cities is growing at faster rates than in the United States and Europe.  Yet the dominant image and scholarship on Latin American has yet to caught up with this reality.  The dominant trend has been to focus on indigenous or traditional communities –which are always imagined as rural and authentic, rather than modern and urbanized. Additionally, when cities are theorized it is often as the subject of pathology, social ills or urban blight.  Seldom do we analyze cities and urbanization processes as key engines of modernization and debates around citizenship, democracy and national identity, or as creative hubs where some of the major social transformations in the area are taking place.  This course will address this void. The first section of the class will examine the current transformation apace across Latin American cities involving rapid urbanization, the growth of neoliberal developments and the transformation of creative industries and economies across the region. We will focus on post 1980s transformations when we see new modes of globalization across the region that presented new openings but also constrains in regards to the development of enclave urbanism, new types of segregation and new imaginaries of class and “urban” identities. The second section of the class will focus on key trends at play in most global cities around the growth of aesthetic and affective work and the reorganization of “culture” in contemporary economies.

The focus of the class will be on developing the automated production skills necessary to function in an Arabic speaking environment. The Emirati dialect is widely understood throughout the Arab speaking world so students will be able to use it to communicate with speakers from many Arab countries mainly the Gulf region. A core component of the class will be the memorization and recitation of dialogues exemplifying basic grammatical patterns, vocabulary, cultural concepts, expressions and intonation patterns of Emirati Arabic. Class activities will include form-focused drills in addition to more communicative, open-ended activities to allow new skills to be practiced. Outside class activities will include field trips and many other forms of cultural exposures and interactions in the community that will help learners enjoy an invaluable experience with both Khaliiji dialect and culture, which will provide students with valuable cultural and linguistic insight relevant to their own lives and will inspire them to open their minds to new experiences and perspectives.

Visual artists, architects, and garden designers played vital roles in imagining and recreating the lost paradise in earthly form.  The history of gardens and landscape in Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, and the Americas has been shaped fundamentally by different interpretations of the Edenic narrative. The course will introduce the study of gardens as a field within the academic discipline of art history.  Art history is an inherently multidisciplinary discipline, asking how pictorial and spatial arts can tell us something about the history of the society in which they are produced and circulated, and, conversely, how economic, social, religious, and political history may help us understand the artistic productions of people remote from us in time, location, or disposition.  Pervasive in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic culture, the theme and imagined appearance of the Garden of Eden are wonderful topics for art historical inquiry.

How does Plato create a foundational myth of Western philosophy out of this criminal sentence? The intersections of literature, film, and policing have shaped the emergence and development of key concepts such as identity, identification, subject, writing, evidence, authorship, and authority. Students will investigate these terms together with the ways crime and the criminal have been defined through time and in different cultures, using the lenses of literature, film, and visual culture in works by Plato, Dostoyevsky, Poe, Conan Doyle, Kafka, Lu Xun, Borges, Nabokov, Herta Müller, Kurosawa, Godard, and Kiarostami, among others.</p>', 'false', 'CCEA-UH 1016', 'Crime', 'true');

This includes violence in the form of divine retribution, as part of the rhetoric of patriarchy, and as necessary for anticolonial nationalism. Students will consider violence both as a theoretical problem as well an aesthetic one as they consider the work of philosophers and theorists while also considering how literary texts drawn from a diverse geographic and historical corpus have attempted to “write” violence as a problem of artistic representation.

This course explores the writer/prophet figure from the Odyssey to the Bible and Qur’an to modern philosophy and contemporary literature and film. It challenges us to examine what we expect of writers, the role they have played as transmitters, diviners, and revealers of “truth,” and their role as social and political critics today. It focuses on how writers look backwards from inside the present or peer into the future through different genres from epic to poetry to prophetic utterances.

Sometimes, however, an extraordinary book may launch a revolution, alter national policy, divide a nation, or unite a continent. Why does this happen to some, but not others? This question seems especially pertinent since a novel is always a hopeful act towards a better world – in both its writing and its reading. This seminar examines the textual, literary, historical, and social circumstances that all owed certain works of fiction to change the facts of our existence. The novel is a relatively young art form that began as entertainment, but its instructive empathy for other ways of being has created an invaluable conversation across borders and between eras. This is why novels are censored or celebrated and why they remain a vital part of the human experience. This seminar examines such novels as Rizal’s Touch Me Not, Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Sinclair’s The Jungle, Achebe’s Things Fall Apart, Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses, Multatuli’s Max Havelaar, and more.

Jazz is, in other words, complicated – its densely textured sound world is entwined with a complex social history. This course immerses students in the world of jazz through an exploration of New York City, the undisputed global capital of the genre. During our regular class sessions and a number of evening excursions, students will meet musicians, attend concerts and jam sessions, tour venues, work in archives, listen to recordings, compare notes on the music, and read a broad array of the best jazz scholarship and journalism. They will dig deep into the history of jazz in the city, and also explore the strange and delightful new shapes jazz is taking in the 21st century.

This course examines that centrality through particular case studies: Mussolini’s Italy, Nazi Germany, Popular Front and Vichy France, and international anti-fascist activity. Through the lens of particular cases we will tackle various questions: May we speak of a general fascist theory of culture and representation? How did fascist governments use aesthetics to respond to modernity, or to help create a modernism of their own? Was the concept of an avant-garde inimical to fascist culture, or useful to it? To what extent was there a movement of international anti-fascist resistance? How did it play out in art, architecture, or literature?

Readings focus on works that consider the specific attributes that adhere to the historically stigmatized categories of illness and disability. We will discover how stigma affects feelings of self-worth and mediates engagement with others. Sociologist Erving Goffman observed that stigma creates “spoiled identities.” Using ideas offered in Goffman’s seminal text on stigma, and anthropologist Mary Douglas’s work on pollution and taboo, students will read other work that deconstructs experiences of stigma in order to destabilize, revise, and repair the personal and social damage stigmatizing categories and behaviors inflict.</p>', 'false', 'CCEA-UH 1045', 'Stigma', 'false'),

As we examine these failed utopias, we will consider how these texts explore the increasingly fraught relationship between humanity and technology, and between the community and the individual. Is any attempt at utopia doomed, given the human proclivity for violence and xenophobia?

Is the purpose of pilgrimage to reach a destination, or is the journey itself, wherever it leads, more important? When is pilgrimage an individual affair, and when are more communal aspects essential to the journey? We begin our journey in India with Ashvagosha\'s Life of the Buddha, and then follow a trail of religious cultural production – including sutras, mandalas, and records of individual pilgrims – that culminates in the Chinese literary masterpiece, Journey to the West.

If confession is no longer always religiously determined, what possesses humans to confess our secrets, and why do readers and spectators care? Furthermore, how does secular confession operate in a globalized world? Do confessional practices traverse the globe? By broadening the Christian definition of confession and drawing on student-generated material, we will examine confession from an intercultural point of view and determine what we can learn about a culture by the kind of secrets it keeps and the nature of its confessional practices.

Yet another view holds that tragedy does too little, that it is merely entertainment in the service of the powers that be – composed, one might argue, by men for men in order to reinforce a particular political, social, and economic outlook. This course examines these and other perennial questions about tragic drama by reading a wide range of plays from different periods and traditions. Authors include Sophocles, Sudraka, Hanquing, Motokiyo, Behn, Ibsen, Artaud, Brecht, Beckett, Soyinka, Glaspell, Parks, and Mouawad.

This course offers a comparative, interdisciplinary approach to Shakespeare’s plays, considering them both as exemplary of Western literature and also as world literature, influential in many cultures. Three sets of questions ground the course: 1) In what ways was Shakespeare a “global” author in his own day, adopting a “worldly” approach that transcends his English context? 2) How do the publication, performance, and critical histories of his plays transform “Shakespeare” into a global commodity? 3) What cultural legacy has Shakespeare’s work left for a variety of global media forms, including plays, films, novels, operas, and works of visual art?

And, ultimately, does the artist have an obligation to address any of these issues in his/her work?

And we can observe a huge variety of attempts to preserve memories: monuments, memorials, museums, libraries, archives, rituals, writing, film, and even ephemeral forms such as blog posts or status updates (nothing gets lost in the Web!). The course allows students to sample these various approaches without being restricted to any one of them as they explore fundamental questions about the relationship between memory and human identity: Is memory everything we can remember, or everything we can forget?

Exploring this wide variety of materials, students will consider a range of questions to understand better how political and cultural formations relate. Is the medium the message? Did mass culture enable nationalism? Are such relationships stable across time and place? Students will examine religious and political arguments in newspapers and pamphlets; nationalist sentiment in poems, plays, and novels; and secondary sources in political science and history.

Additionally, it is the country’s first settler city, a site of continuous indigenous presence, as well as port-of-entry for much of the country’s vast immigrant population. Using literature and the spaces of Sydney itself as a lens, this course examines Australian culture as a place of encounters, movements and crossings. We begin with literary representations of indigenous histories, European invasion and settler colonialism, paired with walking tours of Sydney’s colonial architecture and indigenous art collections at the Australian Museum. We then work our way through literary reckonings of the “White Australia Policy” (dismantled in the late 1960s/early 1970s) and postwar waves of migration and settlement, to consider today’s fragile “multiculturalism” in an age of anti-refugee policies. We will treat Sydney as both a literary space—comprising a complex, contested imaginative and cultural geography—and a space for first-hand inquiry. We’ll supplement in-class readings and discussions by immersing ourselves in Sydney’s cultural institutions and immigrant neighborhoods, as well as its vibrant literary and theatre scene. Remembering that Australia is one of the world’s most urbanized societies, we will take a field trip to the World Heritage-listed Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, to ponder the oversized influence of the “bush” or “outback” in the Australian literary imaginary.

But what exactly is cultural appropriation, and under what circumstances can it be said to constitute a form of exploitation or violence? This course approaches these questions both philosophically and empirically, asking, on the one hand, What is culture, and how can it be “owned” or “stolen”?, and on the other, How have practices of adopting or using culture been implicated in processes of social subjugation or marginalization? Course readings are drawn from a range of disciplines across the humanities and social sciences, including cultural anthropology, art theory, music studies, and philosophy.

Students will get to know what made these cities tick, how they jostled for power in Tuscany, and why their innovations have been so enduring. Our access to these Renaissance cities is largely through art: their buildings, their paintings, and the words in which they were represented, reconfigured, condemned. Thus the seminar explores the way that both contemporaries and moderns imagined those cities, in words, images, and sounds. What kinds of stories did urban Renaissance men and women tell about their communities, the threats they faced from within and without, their hopes and aspirations, their fears as to what life would be like should their cities cease to exist?

Tracing an arc from the ancient world to the present day, students study how the epistemology of modern storytelling across cultures disturbs the familiar patterns of clear and comforting revelation associated with classic genres.

Asking how colonial practices have shaped the causes of global inequality and have influenced the dynamics of recent conflicts, the class also engages with the notion of justice in postcolonial contexts and asks whether former colonizers might have contemporary obligations toward their former subjects.

This course explores the topic of cooperation using insights from economics, evolutionary biology, mathematics, social psychology, and anthropology. The main questions to be addressed are: When is cooperation desirable? When should an individual, an organization, or a country expect others to cooperate?

This course explores the ways in which the desert has been depicted and experienced in various historical, cultural, and geographic contexts – from the Sahara to the Mojave, from the origins of Abrahamic religions to Burning Man, from desert oasis to urban food desert. This course will also consider the future of deserts and global challenges posed by climate change, desertification, and resources (water, oil, solar). Students will encounter the desert through diverse sources that include film, literature, soundscapes, musical performances, environmental and social history, artistic production, fieldtrips, and travel writings.

This course will examine how our understanding of human physiology, genetics, and development, as well as methods of investigations of human anatomy, have shaped the perception of the human body, through history, and across cultures. Students will examine the function of the body and how the understanding of bodily functions has changed (the working body). The course will also delve into the modifications the human body has experienced evolutionarily and how our own body is changing from a single cell until death (the changing body).

What lessons might cosmology have for philosophy, religion, and our general understanding of ourselves as human beings? We will consider the intellectual history of cosmology and its 20th-century transition into a modern scientific discipline, in addition to the contemporary frontiers of cosmological knowledge. Are there reasons to think the origins of the universe were “fine-tuned” for human existence, and does this create conceptual space for theological and philosophical considerations within modern science?

Einstein’s theory of relativity completely altered notions of time and space, laying the theoretical foundation for the use of nuclear power. At the same time, a new quantum theory was developed to describe the behavior of atoms and nuclei. It led to great technological advances, with much modern technology crucially exploiting quantum effects. But the revolutionary advent of relativity and quantum mechanics came with significant consequences: Physics became detached from the public’s everyday experiences and intuition.

Zero was discovered and accepted as a number 1500 years ago; it was considered a dangerous idea in some civilizations. The existence of infinity was fiercely debated by philosophers as well as mathematicians. Understanding numbers requires insights from the liberal arts of the ancient quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy) considered in their unity through their relationships with numbers. Pythagoras, Plato, Al-Kindi, Kepler, Turing, Mandelbrot and others have thought about concepts of measure, order, chaos, harmony, unity, diversity and universality.

This course will examine these big questions about the nature of science in the context of Galileo’s groundbreaking theory on the nature of motion – a theory that laid the groundwork for Newton and the rise of modern science. We will look at the many conflicts in which Galileo became embroiled – scientific, religious, and personal – and study the historical developments that eventually led to widespread acceptance of the Galilean worldview.

Our modern understanding of thinking is shaped by the computer revolution. The class will discuss the underpinnings of the main fields of Psychology (e.g. Behaviorism, Freudian, Cognitive), as well as to how thinking has been viewed in a broader historical and multicultural context.

We will analyze the works of Euclid and Archimedes and others in Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, and Geography, with a particular focus on very modern, and maybe still undiscovered, contents. The achievements of Hellenistic science and the issues it raised will be compared with some of those appearing in other golden ages of science, such as ancient Babylonia, the Islamic Golden Age, the Renaissance, and our times.

This seemingly simple question is one of the deepest in math. The current answers solve many problems but also lead to non-intuitive consequences. Second, is there a unifying theme in mathematics or a set of principles underlying all its branches? If so, would this set be complete? Consistent? Third, seeking a theory of everything in physics would unify all the forces of nature (electromagnetism, weak and strong nuclear forces, and gravity) via combining quantum theory and general relativity.

(354, '<p>What happened to traditional aristocracies with the establishment of modern democracy and how did democracy evolve as a result? This question, on the cutting edge of research within political science, is the organizing question for this course.  Although we focus mainly on the fate of aristocracies in modern democracies, we will also, for purposes of comparison, address the evolution of aristocracies in non-democratic regimes.  Modern democracy is an egalitarian political system that was typically introduced in hierarchical social settings, which often included traditional aristocracies. These aristocracies faced varying fortunes after the establishment of democracy: some survived, others were reinvented and others were wiped out.  These different trajectories have fundamental implications for the trajectory of modern day democracies.  But there is virtually no work in comparative political science that addresses the relationship between aristocracy and modern democracy. This course, therefore, draws on texts chosen from across disciplines to address the following questions: How do we conceptualize an aristocracy (this is by no means obvious). How can we measure variation in the trajectory of aristocracies in modern democracies? And how did this affect variation in the nature of modern democratic politics?   The beginning and end of the course, to be taught in Abu Dhabi, will focus on these questions in a comparative context, drawing on materials that cover regions across the world, including the Europe, Africa, South Asia, North America and the Middle East.

We begin by examining one of history’s most radical and influential democracies, ancient Athens. After reading Thucydides’ complex account of democratic Athens at war, we will turn to ancient debates about democracy found in such authors as Aristophanes, Isocrates, Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle.

Through their readings students will question the notions of a contemporary city and examine how crisis and revitalization compliment each other, especially in the light of current population movements that will only increase with climate change and the ongoing violence of war.  During a week long regional trip, Athens, Greece will serve as a case study of a vibrant historical capital now faced with an unprecedented economic crisis, high unemployment, a large number of refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and economic migrants from as far away as Myanmar. Students’ research will be enriched by a diverse group of faculty and experts who have approached resiliency through multiple disciplines and policy angles. Through readings from the social science literature, policy driven accounts, perspectives of social history, and select works of literature and film, the course will explore possibilities of refuge and resilience in a time of crisis.  <br>NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students and has a trip to Greece.</p>', 'false', 'CSTS-UH 1032J', 'City in Crisis: Refuge and Resilience', 'false'),

We already entrust cyberspace with our privacy, national security, physical safety, and digital identities. Maintaining an orderly, peaceful, safe, and productive society will increasingly depend on maintaining trust in information systems. However, trust cannot be realized by technology alone. This course adopts the viewpoint that cyberspace is a social system that relies on important technical components. The course begins with a discussion of trust, risk, and deception as developed in the social sciences and examines how traditional notions apply or fail to apply to interactions in cyberspace. The second part of the course examines the technical underpinning of cyberspace and the mechanisms developed to create trustworthy systems. The third and final part of the course examines the interplay between the technical and social aspects to see how better policy and systems can be developed to tackle cybercrime, cyberespionage, cyberwar, and cyberterrorism.

Scientists collaborate with each other, undermine one another, and compete for funding of research. Whether a scientific idea ever sees the light of day may depend on these distinctly social factors. So how much of what we call “scientific progress” is the result of social negotiation, and how much is rational deliberation? That is the big question this course investigates – the question of the competing roles of rationality and rhetoric in the development of science. Do theoretical pictures change on account of reasoned argument, or rhetorical persuasion? The course examines this question through the lens of several important scientific revolutions, particularly the quantum one. The starting point will be Thomas Kuhn’s influential account of scientific progress. Does his picture really fit the historical facts? Several competing models of scientific progress will also be discussed. Along the way, students will consider why many scientific revolutions occurred in Europe and not elsewhere.

A gift is free but it can also come with the expectation that it will be matched by a return gift. Gift giving is therefore part of a complex structure of economic and social exchange. This course considers gift giving from the perspectives of anthropology, history, and the arts; it explores gift exchange through ethnographies as well as texts on market economies and art, gender, death, altruism, risk, and the impacts of colonialism on traditional exchange societies.

To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J.

As examples, students will look at property in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome; consider the views on property expressed in Christianity and Islam; and discuss the role that changing views on property played in the Declaration of Independence, the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution.

We examine the difference between societies in which slavery existed and those which can be thought of as “slave societies,” asking how enslavement occurred, who was enslaved, and in what ways did they differ from non-slaves. What “rights” or standing in the law if any did slaves possess? What was the nature and extent of the master’s power over slaves? What were the social, economic, and political functions of slavery? But the study of slavery also inevitably involves broader, more fundamental issues concerning freedom, personhood, social inclusion, and belonging. As Orlando Patterson put it in Slavery and Social Death, “the idea of freedom and the concept of property were both intimately bound up with the rise of slavery, their very antithesis.

This course explores these fundamental questions about beliefs in societies across the globe. It begins by defining ideologies and looking at examples from key intellectual movements of the last millennium (e.g., crusaderism/jihadism, liberalism, communism, fascism, religious nationalism, ethnic nationalism). In this intellectual journey, students read some of the great thinkers who have shaped the concept of ideology over time, including Robespierre, Burke, Jefferson, Marx, Lenin, Mosca, and Benedict Anderson. Next the course asks how to measure ideologies. Students are introduced to quantitative tools for assessing ideologies from both individual-level surveys, voting behavior, and text (e.g., speeches and Twitter).

It asks about the politics of things and their shifting roles in everyday life. What is the nature of taste? of shopping? How do shifts occur depending on object, place, and time? Students will explore the logistics of fashion, the link between goods and geography, production systems, and distribution through retail markets. They will stretch theoretically across the political economy of Marx, neo-classical economics, and the more recent cultural-social schemas of Bruno Latour and Howard Becker.

How can we explain this Great Divergence between Europe and Asia? The course will discuss the classical answers to this question given by Weber, Smith, Marx, and Malthus. Has modern research confirmed or contradicted their views? The roles of demography, politics, law, globalization, social structure, science, and technology will be discussed as well as the interconnections between them.

This course will study how the body has been perceived and experienced across different cultures and societies. It will explore multiple artistic, scientific, and literary representations of the body, as well as the body’s social, institutional, and political dimensions.

The course begins with the theory of money and asks why one uses either barter, commodity, or fiat monies, and the functions money serves. It then traces the history of the development of money and credit across societies to the present day and explores the centrality of money to various cultures and its representation in the arts. Students will discuss governmental manipulation of aggregate monetary stocks to spur or dampen trade or to finance conflict by debasing the value represented by this peculiar good. Such questions explore a central truth, that while modern money is intrinsically meaningless, its role in facilitating economic growth in the supply of real goods and services is surprisingly robust, provided policy does not deliver problems when too much money and credit is in circulation.</p>', 'false', 'CSTS-UH 1048', 'Money', 'false'),

Unfortunately, in popular culture, science is often presented as a series of proven facts. Uncertainty, if acknowledged, is portrayed as an argument between experts with opposing views. While science has resulted in some well-established facts, more commonly scientists have varying degrees of confidence in models and disagree about their significance. This class takes up the language of probability and statistics, explores how it became central to the scientific process, and examines how it is used by different scientific disciplines. Students will also explore how scientific uncertainty is often misrepresented to support particular political agendas or personal beliefs.

This course probes the potential role of green mobility and urban planning in advancing sustainable transportation futures across a range of global contexts.  What transportation investments, technologies, operational enhancements, urban designs, institutional reforms, and pricing regimes offer the most promise in bringing about sustainable urban growth and mobility in coming decades?

We can now see that this triumphalism was a delusion. The election of Donald Trump constituted a shocking repudiation of liberal values. But those precepts have also been retreating across Europe, and in emerging democracies like Turkey and India. Hostility towards elites, and towards immigrants, outsiders and political minorities has fueled virulent forms of populism. Our world is much darker today than it was only a decade ago.

Students will explore historical case studies of the mass media’s coverage of climate change, earthquakes, political crises, refugee emergencies, and war. They will look at ways in which the media can function as an early warning system for future disasters, slowly unfolding political processes, and the gradual degradation of nature.  Is the media responsible in promoting economic development models that have threatened nature? Why it is important not to separate the ecology and economy in national plans, higher studies, and media coverage.  Students will discuss how reporters can cover nature more holistically by re-orienting themselves to cover silent, slow emergencies, and even predict future disasters. They will examine new portals trying to extend the media’s attention span, and thereby the lifespan of stories.  The course includes a field visit to Nepal to see how it is coping with climate change, earthquake and war. Students will visit monuments destroyed in the 2015 earthquake and inspect the reconstruction process, meet scientists researching the impact of global warming on the Himalayan permafrost, and learn about how a photojournalism project helped the healing process after Nepal’s Maoist war. <br> NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students and has a trip to Nepal.</p>', 'false', 'MCC-UH 1003J', 'The Nature of Disasters: Coverage of Climate, Calamity and Conflict in the Media', 'false'),

This course will examine international organizations’ origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance.

(777, '<p>(Formerly PEACE-AD 125J)<br> The Case of Cambodia: In this course you will look into the power of arts and culture as a transformative force. How can safeguarding heritage, curating history, stimulating contemporary expressions, and promoting sustainability and cultural diversity heal a population and rebuild a post-conflict country whilst being a vital actor in sustainable development? What methods are viable, what tools proved useful, what approaches failed? This course will provide a platform to explore and debate this specific approach to reconstruction, revitalization, reconciliation and peacebuilding.  After gaining independence in 1953, the country experienced a formative period of monarchy, a coup d’etat and heavy American bombing before Cambodia’s dark era began in 1975. For almost four years the Khmer Rouge imposed their radical agro-communist ideology on the people, leaving two million people dead and many starved and overworked. In 1979, the Khmer Rouge regime was defeated by Vietnamese forces and a new government was installed, some of whose members were former Khmer Rouge cadres.  The case of Cambodia with its troubled past provides the backdrop for exploring issues of changing dominant narratives, governance of culture, social welfare, cultural economy, and many others. Through contextualization you will discover the social, cultural, economic and political interdependencies that frame the Cambodian arts ecosystem. You will get to know institutions, individuals, networks and structural frameworks that shape transformation processes in and through the culture sector. The course is designed to allow for a wide range of engagement with the topic and the country: narration and film, history and theory, performance and experience, site visits and interviews, as well as a group project. The aim of the course is to stimulate discussions, reflect on practices, ideas and visions. You are encouraged to ask questions and discover your own experiences with arts and culture during conflicts, their prevention and dealing with their aftermath. Think of critical situations in places and communities you are attached to and the role of arts in these. Ultimately, it is your creativity and inspiration that will shape the next innovative approach to the use of arts in processes of post-conflict transformation, preconflict prevention and peacebuilding.

Abu Dhabi itself recently discovered evidence of this type of communality between Muslims and Christians.

But is there a point, is there significance to life as a whole? That is the question about the “meaning of life.” Though the question is notoriously hard to make precise, one way or another it has animated much literature and art, and also much philosophy. Some philosophers have provided disheartening answers: life is suffering, and then it ends; life is absurd, and never gains any meaning; life is all about creating hell for each other, and we cannot escape. But other philosophers have provided more uplifting answers to support the quest for personal significance. Both kinds of answers deserve scrutiny. Such scrutiny should be of interest to anybody who wishes to reflect on her/his life as a whole as part of her/his education. After reviewing several pessimistic and more optimistic approaches to the meaning of life we turn to the subject of death. We will all die eventually. We normally encounter death among family and friends before we must deal with our own. These themes too are the subject of philosophical reflection. We finish with a class on a recent discussion of the connection between individual significance and the future of humanity.  This class is wide-ranging, and will integrate historical figures, references to art and literature as wel l as to science as appropriate. But its main focus is on contributions by recent thinkers in the Anglo-American analytical tradition of philosophy. The methodology is philosophical.

In addition to exposing students to theories of revolution from different historical epochs and cultural contexts, this course is structured by four case studies through which we will explore some of the main contradictions that have defined revolutionary movements: the American Revolution (the vexed relationship between slavery and capitalism; the effort to defend legalized slavery while securing freedom from British tyranny), the Haitian Revolution (how enslaved peoples built a sovereign republic yet struggled to secure diplomatic recognition), the Cuban Revolution (and the idea of humanitarian warfare, such as Che Guevara’s insistence on providing medical attention to enemy soldiers, as well as the pivotal role that Cuba would play in African liberation struggles and the regular practice of sending teachers, doctors, and soldiers to assist other developing countries), and, finally, the Eritrean Revolution (fought against the colonial government of Ethiopia, heralded for being but one of but two African countries that was never colonized).  This course will involve an excursion to Asmara, Eritrea. There, students will visit two sites. The first, located in the capital city of Asmara, is the “Tank and Truck Graveyard,” a shrine to vehicles used in the thirty-year liberation struggle against Ethiopia. The second site we visit will be the port city of Massawa, where the most important battle of the liberation struggle was fought. Massawa is also a city of tremendous historical significance.

We will then turn our attention to the diversity of populations resulting from historical and contemporary migrations to the Gulf, looking at the complex questions they raise in terms of belonging and citizenship.

On the one hand, there is the expectation that the vestiges of a post-Enlightenment heritage will offer these developed societies the framework to construct a truly egalitarian social and economic order. At the same time, we are trained theoretically to confront the inevitability of stratification, especially in societies motivated by capitalism. In turn, this brings us to an academic dilemma that rests at the very cornerstone of evolved meritocracies: if stratification is inevitable, then is inequality acceptable so long as it is “fairly” achieved? This “fair” justification for inequality is pervasive and most easily accepted: and in turn, problematic. Because so much of current inequality in society can be justified, most social processes do not seem extreme or blatantly unequal until it is too late.

This Writing Seminar invites students into a close and careful examination of the written, oral and visual representations of the American West in order to analyze and explore the mythologies that contribute to a national identity. <br>These representations are often set against a backdrop of unimaginable physical beauty and natural wonder.

These mythic tales about the promise of America continue to fascinate and frustrate.

Such projects mobilize the senses in ways fundamental to their reception, implementation, and impact.

What does the cosmopolitan worldview offer us? Why might we be wary of patriotism, and when might we embrace it? In the final third of the course, we will bring our consideration of cosmopolitanism and nationalism to bear as we examine global higher education and NYU’s own Global Network University, an institution both founded on cosmopolitan ideals and bound by its physical campuses inside national borders.</p>', 'false', 'WRIT-UH 1118', 'FYWS: Citizens of Nowhere', 'false'),

This FYWS sets out to investigate and map three distinct cities: Mumbai, Kampala, and Abu Dhabi. Considering each city as shaped by the ways citizens “practice” their everyday activities, students will examine different ways each city is represented in film, fiction, travel narratives, and scholarship from such fields as media, literary, and postcolonial studies . In the case of Abu Dhabi, students will also experience the city as pedestrians. Writing assignments include one essay on each city, each increasing in complexity, and each following different lines of inquiry: How is the city represented and shaped in different media? What are its stereotypes? Its conceptions of otherness or cosmopolitanism? What is urban culture and how does it differ from national culture? Who gets to claim a city as home? In the final research project and oral presentations, students will choose a method of inquiry and point of interest in Abu Dhabi, and in the process have to consider their own identities as its inhabitants.</p>', 'false', 'WRIT-UH 1119', 'FYWS: Living Cities', 'false'),

While we tend to think about childhood as a natural, biological category, this First-Year Writing Seminar will address ways in which different societies have invented and shaped their own definitions of this concept. By critically engaging with a corpus of primary and secondary sources, students will think about permanence and change across time and geographical areas and in doing do redefine ideas we often take for granted. Materials will include academic texts, newspaper articles, travel accounts, short stories, comic books, and movies. Class discussions and writing assignments will focus on the following questions: How do we know what we know about childhood? How do notions of gender, class, and race inform definitions of childhood? And what is the relevance of the past to our understanding of childhood in the present?</p>', 'false', 'WRIT-UH 1120', 'Inventions of Childhood', 'false'),
(1147, '<p>Scent is one of life’s greatest pleasures, deeply tied to culture and memory—and yet much about how and why we smell remains mysterious. This First-Year Writing Seminar draws on many disciplines to examine ties between scent, science, and culture. Does smell have an evolutionary history? Can a concept like synesthesia—the connection between different senses—allow us to write expressively about smells, describe and analyze fragrances or flavors, or argue about scent’s place in a hierarchy of human senses? Readings include classical and Islamic philosophy, religious texts, medieval alchemy and sorcery, modern philosophy, psychology, anthropology, and the history of science. Field trips to perfumeries, gardens, art exhibitions, restaurants, and campus laboratories allow for interviews with a range of practitioners. Digital exercises enable the analysis of complex chemical data. Students will learn to compare, synthesize, and write effectively about methods and sources as they ask how disparate forms of evidence help us better understand biological attraction, constructions of beauty, feelings of disgust, and why we entangle odors with ideas about gender, race, and ethnicity.</p>', 'false', 'WRIT-UH 1121', 'FYWS: Making Sense of Scents', 'false'),
(1148, '<p>In the modern world, people believe themselves to be more closely connected than ever before. But might connectivity both deepen and potentially obstruct our common understanding? This writing seminar critically examines the notions of modern connectivity and communication. By framing connectivity and communication as trans-regional and cross-cultural processes, this course questions global political structures and social-cultural trends that shape our beliefs and allows students to question some common assumptions about how people form relationships with each other. Course materials draw on seminal texts in the field of global history, including excerpts from Bayly’s The Birth of the Modern World, 1780–1914, and on essays and scholarly articles from fields such as sociology, anthropology, history, and communication studies. Through readings, class discussions, presentations, peer critique, and writing assignments, this course will deepen students’ understanding of communication--and miscommunication--in the world we have inherited.</p>', 'false', 'WRIT-UH 1122', 'FYWS: Worlds Connected, Worlds Apart', 'false');
